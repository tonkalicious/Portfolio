## Trending video on YouTube:
    Answered the questions:
    
        What was the category breakdown for trending videos in different regions last week?
        How were likes and dislikes distributed among trending categories?
        
## EDA_vehicle advertisement:

    I was analyzing data for a company where hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on a web site every day.
    I had to study data collected over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.

## Business Analytics Project:
    Optimization of the marketing expenses:
    
    Some of the metrics I have calculated and visually presented are: DAU, MAU, WAU, number od sessions per day on different devices, average number od sessions pers day, average duration of sessions, retention and conversion rate for each cohort, number of orders per cohort, average number of orders, average purchase size, LTV, marketing costs, CAC, ROI, net profit.
    
    I gave some recommendations and advised marketing experts how much money to invest and where.
    
## prioritizing_hypotheses_launch_and_ AB_test_analysis

    In this project I prioritized hypothesis using ICE and RICE framework.
    I made visualizations:
        
        Cumulative revenue by group (A and B group in AB testing).
        Cumulative average order size by group.
        Relative difference in cumulative average order size for group B compared with group A.
        
    I calculated percentiles for the number of orders per user.<br>
    Finding the statistical significance (of the difference in conversion, difference in average order size) on raw and filltered data.
