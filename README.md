## Project: *KYC - Know Your Customer*

As a financial institution regulated by the FCA, N26 has the obligation to verify the identity of all
customers who want to open a N26 account. Each prospective customer has to go through a
Know Your Customer (KYC) process by submitting a government-issued photo ID and a facial
picture of themself to our partner.

Our goal is to find out which of the verification stages most often leads to the 'consider' for the result_doc column.

We can see from visualization that clear documentation have around 65% of potential customers. Around 35% have not clear documentation so we should look into that.

For 'result_doc' column very high correlation coefficient (0,935) has next stage of KYC:
    
    - image_integrity_result - Asserts whether the document was of sufficient quality to verify.

For 'result_face' column very high correlation coefficient (0,951) has next stage of KYC:

    - facial_image_integrity_result - Asserts whether the quality of the uploaded files and the content
                                      contained within them were sufficient to perform a face comparison

**These parameters have a great influence on the final KYC result.**
