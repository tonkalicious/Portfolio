    I was analyzing data for a company where hundreds of free advertisements for vehicles are published on your site every day.
    I had to study data collected over the last few years and determine which factors influence the price of a vehicle.

4. prioritizing_hypotheses_launch_and_ AB_test_analysis

    In this project I prioritized hypothesis using ICE and RICE framework.<br>
    I made visualizations:
        
        Cumulative revenue by group (A and B group in AB testing).
        Cumulative average order size by group.
        Relative difference in cumulative average order size for group B compared with group A.
        
    I calculated percentiles for the number of orders per user.<br>
    Finding the statistical significance (of the difference in conversion, difference in average order size) on raw and filltered data.
