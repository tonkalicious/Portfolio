## Project description:

I work as a video ad analyst at the advertising agency and devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention.

Each video has a specific category (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics,
etc.), region, and trending date.

A video can be in the trending section for several days in a row. To analyze
user impressions (likes and dislikes), analysts use data from the last day it was
trending.

Every week I need to answer the questions:

  - What was the category breakdown for trending videos in different regions
last week?

  - How were likes and dislikes distributed among trending categories?
