## General conclusion:
<a id="general"></a>

What sources/platforms would you recommend? Back up your choice: what metrics did you focus on? Why? What conclusions did you draw after finding the metric values?

I would definetly recommend sources number 1, 2 and 5. All three of them have very high number of orders, high average purchase size, high revenue by user, high ROI and high net revenue. Source 1 has the best retention rate and it has top conversion. Source 2 has the highest conversion and highest average purchase pro cohort. Source 5 has the highest number of visits, still the conversion rate is 11% on the day of registration. By source 1 conversion rate is around 20%.

This is the reason add campaign should have more add investments into these three sources.

source 3 has the biggest marketing costs, high number of visits but negative profit, it has realy low retention and conversion is around 11%. The marketing costs should be cut down significantly because this source seems not to be profitable.

Source 4 is also quite invested from marketing but this source has low retention and average conversion. It still has high net revenue so maybe the marketing cost should not be cut intensively.

Source number 6 is not included in the add campaign and has one of the lowest number of visits. Even though there were no conversions and no orders, this source has the second best retention rate (after source 1) on the day of registration. After the day of registration there were no users coming back. You should maybe conside to invest something to this source.

Source 7 is similar to source 6 with only difference there were no users coming back.

Source 9 has high ROI value and high conversion. With a bit higher investments in add campaigns, number of visitors should be then higher and hopeful the retention as well.

Source 10 is similar to the source 9 with the difference of low net revenue. This source also seems to be unprofitable.

It would be useful to know is it possible to have purchases with zero purchase size like the data showed. There were also identical purchases made in the same time from same user from different sources. Better data information would have been more helpful.
